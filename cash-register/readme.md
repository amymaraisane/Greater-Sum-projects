*** Exact Change Challenge ***

I used TDD to create a function that accepts three arguments, purchase price (price), payment (cash), and a 2D cash-in-drawer array containing all available coin/bill denomination amounts (cid). The function returns an exact change array based on what is available in the drawer. If there is not enough cash available, it returns "Insufficient Funds". If the exact change given is equal to the change in the drawer, our cashier has to close up shop so it returns "Closed".
