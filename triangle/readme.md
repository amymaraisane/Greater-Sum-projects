Notes on my revisions: 

After thinking about it, it does not make sense that a triangle should be able to have any sides with length of 0 so I changed that. 

Based on my continued learning about writing good tests, I separated my new tests into more specific "it" statements". This caused me to also change the wording of the other "it" statements so they match. I am still learning about the best practice for naming tests, but this way seems more specific and useful to me.  

One thing I want to keep learning more about is how many times I should test the same concept across different scenarios. Example- here I chose to separate "very large numbers and very small numbers" into its own "it" block and use a few examples that create each type of triangle. But I can tell that deciding how many and what type of example cases are needed is a very important question.
